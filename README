todo
----------

Todo list application for CLI. I wanted something that didn't require a God damn web browser or GTk3333333 to use. I've done a few iterations over the years and settled on C++ for now. I'm sure I'll do it in Assembly or Nim but for now C++ is fine.
Installing:

Need make installed

https://www.gnu.org/software/make/

After that you can run the following:

make -- Run make for debug builds. This will create a ./bin/todo directory and file.

make release -- Run make release to build a stripped binary. This will create a ./pkg/todo directory and file.

make install -- This will install the RELEASE binary in /usr/local/bin/. Make sure this is in your $PATH before running.

make clean -- This will delete the ./bin/ directory.

Usage:
You can always run "todo help" to get a better breakdown of this on the command line.

Basic overview -- todo cmd args
cmd -- add | done | update | delete | list
args -- todo to add | todo to complete | todo to update | todo to delete | list all todos

Examples:

todo add Write more C
todo update 1 Write a lot more C
todo add Setup new project repos
todo done 2
todo list
todo del 2
